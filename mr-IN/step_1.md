You often get a better visual effect by diffusing (spreading out) the light from an LED, especially if you are using clear LEDs or RGB LEDs that mix multiple colours.

Placing an LED behind a material such as thin paper, tracing paper or invisible sticky tape will spread the light over a larger area and create a softer effect that is nicer to look at.

You can also use a white material, such as paper to direct light in the direction you want it to be seen from so that you make the most of the light from the LED.
